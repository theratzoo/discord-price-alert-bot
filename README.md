### Simple Price Alert Bot- a discord bot

This bot simply takes in a table of "buy tables"- a table showing different prices of an asset that I want to buy if it drops to that price- and alerts me when the price drops so much. This idea originated because I am sick of constantly looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum's price. 

For now, it just tracks the google sheets for those two cryptos, but the following features are being developed:

* support for US markets (specifically I buy VOO and VTI)
* support for price sell alerts (I plan to make tables for selling parts of my crypto to DCA-out of the bull run)
* modular support (basically let anyone use it for any crypto, stock, etc, etc. that is when this can get released publicly)
* any small TODOs found in the code (especially regarding bot commands)
